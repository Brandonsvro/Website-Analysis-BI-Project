**Project Overview**

This is a data analysis training project from the bootcamp I attended (Pacmann AI). In this project, I was asked to analyze the website performance of an e-commerce company with various metrics, from the beginning of the website launch to several months of the website running.

**Data Overview**
The data used in this project is provided by Pacmann AI, consisting of 3 tables:
1. website_sessions
2. website_pageviews
3. Orders

**Business Case**
The company Copee launched its e-commerce website on March 19, 2012. To build market awareness, they ran advertisements across several digital channels. Over the coming period, they plan to analyze the traffic and performance of their website.

As a data analyst, the manager have assigned me to handle the required analyses on an ongoing basis.

**CASE 1.** One month after the website's launch (March 19 - April 30), the manager wants to evaluate its initial performance by analyzing weekly traffic trends, top traffic sources, and a detailed analysis of those sources.

**CASE 2.** Based on the first month's review, optimizations for the 'gsearch nonbrand' campaign and the '/home' landing page were implemented. The manager has requested a re-evaluation of the optimization results after one month (April 30 - May 31). These results will determine the next steps for further optimization.

**CASE 3.** With the '/home' landing page optimization showing no results, the manager decided to conduct A/B testing  for a new landing page named '/lander-1' for 'gsearch nonbrand' traffic.  This landing page was launched on June 19, and the A/B test ran for one month (June 19 - July 31).

**CASE 4.** After optimizing the performance of the 'gsearch nonbrand' campaign and landing page, the manager directed us to conduct a comprehensive funnel analysis for all traffic sources to identify pages with high exit rates. The manager also wants to understand when traffic starts to peak on the website to gain better insights into traffic behavior. (19 March - 31 July)
